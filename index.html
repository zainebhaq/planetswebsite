  <h2>The Far</h2>
  <h1>Beyond</h1>
  <p class="solarsystem">The planetary system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.

    Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury,
    Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions
    of asteroids, comets and meteoroids.

    Beyond our own solar system, there are more planets than stars in night sky. So far, we have discovered thousands
    of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way, with more planets being found all the time. Most of
    the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy are thought to have planets of their own, and the Milky Way is but
    one of perhaps 100 billion galaxies in the universe.

    While our planet is in some ways a mere speck in the vast cosmos, we have a lot of company out there. It seems
    that we live in a universe packed with planets — a web of countless stars accompanied by families of objects,
    perhaps some with life of their own.</p>

          <p class="description"> Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around
            the Sun takes 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman
            deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods </p>

          <p class="description"> Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love
            and beauty. As the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows
            and, rarely, is visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. </p>

          <p class="description"> Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to
            harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
            Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's
            only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days, a period known as an Earth sidereal
            year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 365.256 times. </p>

          <p class="description"> Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is
            a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other
            planets in the Solar System combined. </p>

          <p class="description"> Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System,
            after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. It has only
            one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more
            massive. </p>

          <p class="description"> Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius
            and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and
            both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.

            the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the
            densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin
            Uranus. </p>
